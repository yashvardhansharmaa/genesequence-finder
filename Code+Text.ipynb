    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the largest common subsequence algorithm can be used to infer which strings are more strongly related to each other. <br>\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "• This algorithm finds the longest sequence of characters that are common between two strings.  <br>\n",
    "• The longer the common subsequence, the stronger the relationship between the two strings. <br>\n",
    "• Therefore, if two strings have a longer common subsequence than another pair of strings, it implies that the first pair is more strongly related than the second pair. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages <br>\n",
    "• <b>Efficiency:</b>  It is relatively efficient, with a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences. This means that the algorithm can be applied to relatively long sequences without requiring a prohibitive amount of computation time. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "• <b>Practicality:</b> It can be used to measure the similarity of two strings is in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as spell checking or plagiarism detection. In these cases, the LCS algorithm can be used to compare two strings and determine how similar they are, which can then be used to identify potential errors or instances of copying in the text.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "• <b>Length Bias:</b> The LCS itself is biased by the length of the input strings. This means that two strings of different lengths may have the same LCS, even if they are not actually very similar. For example, two strings that are identical except for extra characters at the end may have the same LCS as two completely different strings of the same length.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In such cases, using a metric like the <b>LCS ratio</b>, which takes into account both the length of the LCS and the length of the input strings, can provide a more accurate measure of the similarity between the two strings. The LCS ratio is calculated by dividing the length of the LCS by the length of the longest input string, and it ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (complete similarity). Using the LCS ratio can help to avoid the bias introduced by the length of the input strings and provide a more accurate measure of the similarity between two strings.<br>\n"

    "The code creates an ancestry tree based on a given LCS matrix. It does this by finding the element with the largest LCS sum, which becomes the root of the tree. It then creates the tree in a greedy manner, by adding children to each node in the tree such that each child has the largest LCS with its parent that isn't already in the tree. The resulting ancestry tree is returned. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "The code takes in an LCS matrix and uses it to create an ancestry tree. An LCS matrix is a square matrix where the element at row i and column j represents the longest common subsequence between two sequences i and j. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The code first initializes an ancestry tree, which is represented as a list where the element at index i represents the parent of node i in the tree. The root of the tree is initially set to None. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Next, the code finds the root of the tree by iterating over the rows in the LCS matrix. For each row, it sums up all the elements in the row and compares it to the current maximum sum. If the current sum is greater than the current maximum sum, then the index of the current row is recorded as the root of the tree. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Once the root of the tree has been found, the code then adds children to each node in the tree. It does this in a greedy manner, by adding the child to each node such that the child has the largest LCS with its parent that isn't already in the tree. The left child of each node is given by 2 * i + 1 and the right child is given by 2 * i + 2, where i is the index of the parent node. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Once all the children have been added to the tree, the ancestry tree is returned.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## How is it greedy?\n",
    "This approach is greedy because at each step, it makes a <b>locally optimal choice</b> in the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. In particular, when adding children to a node in the tree, the code <b>always chooses the child with the largest LCS with its parent</b>, even if this may not be the best choice in the long run. This local optimality is a key feature of greedy algorithms. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the context of this code, the greedy strategy is used to build an ancestry tree with a large overall LCS. By choosing children with the largest LCS with their parents at each step, the code hopes to end up with a tree that has a large overall LCS, even if this may not be the best possible tree. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is this inaccurate?\n",
    "There are two key reasons to why this approach is inaccurate and does not present the optimal code. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Firstly, the <b>code only considers the LCS between a parent and a child</b> when adding children to the tree. However, the ancestry tree should also consider the LCS between siblings and cousins, which this code does not do. This means that the tree produced by this code may not have the maximum overall LCS. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Secondly, the code <b>uses a greedy strategy to build the tree</b>, which may not necessarily lead to the optimal tree. As mentioned earlier, the code always chooses the child with the largest LCS with its parent, even if this may not be the best choice in the long run. This means that the tree produced by this code may not have the maximum overall LCS.<br>\n",

Here, the 1 is added to the minimum value of the three surrounding characters in the table if they are different because it represents the cost of the edit. In this case, it would represent the cost of adding, deleting, or replacing a character in the word. <br>\n",

    "<b>Time complexity of this function: Big-O(mn)</b>, where m and n are the length of the two input words. <br>\n",

    "This is because the function uses a dynamic programming approach that involves filling out a 2-dimensional table with m+1 rows and n+1 columns.

This allows the function to avoid repeating the same calculations multiple times, which can improve the overall performance of the algorithm. <br> \n",

Then, the distances between pairs of strings are computed and stored in the array, starting from the shortest strings and gradually moving on to longer strings.<br> "

    "## Algorithmic Strategy\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This code uses a dynamic approach to create a family tree based on a given matrix of Levenshtein distances. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>High Level Strategy:</b> The function first converts the matrix into a dataframe and a dictionary for easier processing. It then uses the greedy approach to find the ancestry tree, starting with the string with the smallest maximum distance to its other string descendants. The function then finds the two strings with the smallest distances to the parent string and removes them from the dictionary. It repeats this process until there are no more strings left in the dictionary. The resulting ancestry tree is returned as a list of strings.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Steps:</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "• It takes the grandparent with the least distance from the matrix and adds it to the family tree. <br>\n",
    "• Then, it takes the two children of the grandparent with the least distance and adds those to the family tree. <br>\n",
    "• It continues this process until all the distances in the matrix are exhausted. This way, it builds a family tree that minimizes the total Levenshtein distance. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the grandparent selected?\n",
    "The way to determine the grandparent in the genealogy tree is to find the least similar pairs in the tree. This is because it allows us to identify the farthest members of the family. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, in the case of a family tree, the grandmother should be the least similar to one of the grandchildren because she is two generations and one intermediary person away from the farthest member of the family. By identifying the grandmother, we can then use the information about the most similar people to her to determine the relationships between the other members of the family. This allows us to establish the family tree generation by generation (using the family tree function) by first determining the grandparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the parent-child relationship determined in the family tree function?\n",
    "• In this code, the algorithm compares the parent node to all potential children nodes and finds the two nodes with the least distance away from the parent node. These two nodes are then selected as the children nodes of the parent node. <br>\n",
    "• The algorithm is then used to compare the two children nodes to all potential grandchildren nodes and the process repeats until all nodes in the tree have been selected. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is this apporach global? \n",
    "The above code uses a global strategy by first creating a dictionary of the Levenshtein distances between all pairs of strings in the given matrix. This dictionary is used to find the string with the highest maximum distance to any other string, which is selected as the root of the ancestry tree. As noted by the above functions that are used to employ this strategy (i.e. the levenshtein and levenshtein matrix functions), <b>they employ dynammic programming to ensure efficiency</b>.  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The code then uses a recursive function, family_tree(), to find the two strings with the least Levenshtein distances to the current parent string, add them as children to the parent, and repeat this process for each child. This process continues until there are no more children left to add to the tree, at which point the ancestry tree is returned. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Thus, by considering all the relationships between the strings at once and identifying the grandparent (i.e. the root of the ancestry tree) by analysing the entire levenshtein matrix, the code is able to build the entire ancestry tree using a global strategy.<br>\n"

    "### Complexity Analysis of Greedy Approach Function\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Time Complexity: O (n ^ 2)</b>  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This is because the function is <b>iterating through each item in the dictionary twice</b>, once for the first child and once for the second child. This results in two nested loops, which results in an O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Recurrence Relation: T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + O(n^2)</b> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This relation states that the function is recursive in nature and executes itself twice with a reduction in the input size. This means that the time complexity of this function is exponential, since it is increasing by a factor of 2 in each iteration, which is support by the time complexity of Big-O (n^2) of the function. This means that this function is not suitable for large data structures, as it will take too long for it to complete.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Overall, this function has a relatively high time complexity and may not be the most efficient solution for processing large matrices. A more efficient solution would be to use a divide and conquer approach, which would result in a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case."

    "• <b>No mutations are lost and then regained along ancestry</b>: Genetic mutations or changes do not reverse themselves over time. In other words, any genetic change that occurs in one generation will not be reversed in the next generation, and any gene that is lost in one generation will not be regained in the next.  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "• <b>Increasing breadth of the genealogy tree leads to increasing differences in genes strings</b>: Based on the idea of genetic drift. In genetic drift, genetic variation between individuals increases as the size of the gene pool decreases. As the breadth of the genealogy tree increases, the number of individuals in the gene pool decreases, resulting in an increase in the differences between genes. This means that, as the breadth of the genealogy tree increases, the differences between genes also increases. As an example, the genes of two children (in the first generation) will be more similar than those of their children (i.e. the grandchildren) because the size of the gene pool has decreased from two to one."

    "\n",
    "The  is a more accurate approach to finding the ancestry tree using gene strings because it considers the distances between the strings, rather than just the LCS. In genetics, the distance between two strings is a measure of how different they are, and it is important to consider this in determining their ancestry relationship. By starting with the string with the smallest maximum distance to its descendants, approach two ensures that the tree is built in a way that accurately reflects the distances between the strings. "

Similarly, the runtime at 20 input size (i.e. double of the first one) is approximately 0.5seconds. <br>\n",

    "• Insertion: 9.3%<br>\n",
    "• Deletion: 4.1%<br>\n",
    "• Replacement: 4.9%<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The probabilities we have calculated indicate that we are making more insertions than other types of operations when transforming our parent genes to child genes. This suggests that our child genes have a longer average length than their parent genes. The small ratio between the number of insertions and deletions suggests that both operations have a similar likelihood of occurring.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "These probabilities can be used to predict potential changes or additions to the genome tree if we were to insert new child nodes. For example, we could use these probabilities to construct new gene sequences from a parent node, taking into account the likelihood of insertions, deletions, and replacements.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Additionally, the relatively low probabilities suggest that we are doing a minimal number of operations when transforming a parent gene to a child gene. This also suggested that the solution presented by the global approach is likely optimised. If we were to construct a tree with lower probabilities, we could argue that the ordering of that tree would be more optimal compared to our current tree.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However, it is important to keep in mind that these probabilities are only applicable to the subset of genes we have been given, and may not be representative of the overall genetic population. As such, we should be cautious when making any broad conclusions based on these probabilities.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "• <b>#cs110-ComputationalCritique:</b> In my assignment, I successfully applied the above outcomes to evaluate and compare the time-complexity of different algorithms used to identify gene mutation by computing the Levenshtein distance. Additionally, I provided an in-depth analysis of the time resources needed by each algorithm. <br>\n",
    "• <b>#cs110-ComplexityAnalysis:</b> In the complexity analysis, I clearly and accurately derived the scaling growth of my global approach while also interpreting its results and how it affects the efficency and applicability in different contexts and uses. Additionally, I provide a clear and accurate explanation of the recurrence relation of the functions provided in the assignment with their interpretations. <br>\n",
    "• <b>#cs110-Professionalism:</b> I've communicated the work in this assignment in an effective, clear, and concise manner such that clear insights are provided such as each of the different functions are supported by a clearly communicated explanation that allow for clear insights. <br>\n",
    "• <b>#cs110-PythonProgramming:</b> In my programming, the code for LCS, Levenshthein, their matrices, and approaches are is accurate; added three more assertion statements (in addition to the 3 provided in the assignment) for LCS demonstrate that the implementation is correct. This is the LO that I've had the most progress in this semester. Despite still not being able to write perfect, efficient code, I've made tremendous improvement in my coding ability from starting Minerva last year with zero coding experience to now being able to write these hundreds of lines of code. <br>\n",
    "• <b>#cs110-CodeReadability:</b> The code written in this assignment includes clear and correct variable names; is supplemented by a descriptive docstring and inlcudes an approprapriate amount of comments (reduce from the previous assignments where I received feedback about excessive comments). Additionally, assert statements were added to the LCS and Levenshtein function to check for their validity.  <br>\n",
    "• <b>#cs110-AlgoStratDataStruct:</b> I've thoroughly applied this LO in this assignment. Every code/function programmed in this assignment is supported by an explanation of how it works and the algorithmic strategy behind it that is explained in simple, plain language. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### HCs\n",
    "• <b>#algorithms:</b> Throughout this assignment, I've proficiently implemented this HC by clearly identifying the adequate algorithmic strategies while justifying their choice as well as providing a clear, detailed, and appropriate explanation of how it works and each of its steps through text in Markup cells, comments in the codecells, and detailed docstrings. <br>\n",
    "• <b>#probability:</b> I accurately wrote code for the function to compute the probabilities of the different mutations and explained it appropriately; additionally, I clearly and correctly interpreted what the different probabilities suggest and what inferences we can possibly draw from them. <br>\n",
    "• <b>#evidencebased:</b> I've supported my analysis in this assignment by ensuring that they were evidenced-based, wherever plausible. For instance, I included the assumptions/constraints of the use of the algorithm in real-life applications and the assumptions (i.e. genetic drift) that are supported by scientific evidence; additionally, I limited my random string generator to the lowest of 76 length as that is the lowest amount of base pairs (which vary from 76 to upto 2 million).
